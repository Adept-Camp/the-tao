THE TRULY AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATION
=================================

"The TAO" is a foundational framework for building DAOs, itself built using the
dappsys framework. It is not monolithic: it's up to you to either deploy your
own instance and grow it into something noteworthy, or to find a way to join an
existing instance.

Each instance has its own tokens, aims, and membership requirements. Each
instance's tokens may be exchanged via any exchange or contract with ERC20 token
support. Each instance is autonomous.

Starting a "The TAO" instance gets you:

* The ability to issue ERC20 tokens.
* The ability to add and remove members.
* The ability to make and vote on proposals.
* The ability to add-on and expand in any direction.


STRUCTURE
=========

Within both dappsys and "The TAO", sensitive functions are protected by an
`auth` modifier. Each "The TAO" instance has a single DSBasicAuthority instance
called the "root authority." Functions guarded by an `auth` modifier in "The
TAO" instances can only be called by contracts and accounts that have been given
permission to do so via the `setCanCall` function on the root authority.

The `setCanCall` function takes first the address which will be calling the
protected function, the address of the contract with the protected function, the
4-byte signature of the protected function, and a boolean indicating whether to
allow or disallow calling the function. By default, protected functions cannot
be called. If a contract or address calls a protected function which it does not
have permission to call, then the protected function throws.

The DSBasicAuthority is itself governed by the dappsys authority system.
Contracts using the dappsys authority system can either be in "authority" mode,
in which case protected functions work as discussed in the above paragraph, or
in "owner" mode, in which case the contract's `_authority` address (and only its
`_authority` address) may call any of the contract's protected functions.

The root authority's authority is a DSEasyMultisig instance, which provides
n-of-m voting on proposals. The root authority itself is in "owner" mode, so the
DSEasyMultisig instance may call any function on the root authority. Proposals
consist of transactions which will be sent by the multisig to the given target
if n-of-m members confirm and then trigger it within the voting window set when
the multisig was deployed.

Every component in "The TAO", except for the multisig, is governed by the root
authority via the dappsys authority system.

The token system consists of a DSTokenFrontend instance which implements the
ERC20 interface and acts as a thin wrapper around a DSTokenController instance.
The DSTokenController instance has a DSBalanceDB instance which keeps track of
each address' token balance and a DSApprovalDB instance which keeps track of
allowances between addresses. This structure allows for easy changing of token
logic in the event a bug is discovered without any risk of losing balances or
allowances.

For token issuance, a DSTokenSupplyManager instance is also provided. New tokens
may be issued to a caller using the `demand` function. This function may be used
by contracts in conjunction with proposals granting such contracts the necessary
permissions to issue pre-determined numbers of tokens to pre-determined
addresses in a trustless manner. More concretely, one may write a contract which
calls `demand` to grant itself some number of tokens and then send the tokens on
to other addresses and then self-destruct or otherwise lock itself out of
executing again. The multisig holders at that point may review the deployed
contract's code and opt to grant it the necessary permissions to call `demand`
on the supply manager. At that point the contract may be executed and the
beneficiaries will receive their requested tokens.

DEPLOYMENT
==========

In order to help create new instances of "The TAO", there is an instance of a
contract called TheTAOFactory which can be used to create and set up instances
of "The TAO". A simple deployment with a 2-of-3 multisig governance contract
and a 72 hour voting window can be created by calling `createBasicInstance(2, 3,
72*60*60)` on the factory contract. A deployment with the calling address as the
owner of the root authority can be created by calling `createOwnedInstance()`. A
multisig contract with the aforementioned parameters can later be installed on
an owned root authority by first calling `updateAuthority(&lt;factory address&gt;, 0)`
on the root authority to make it owned by the factory and then calling
`setupMultisig(&lt;root authority address&gt;, 2, 3, 72*60*60)` on the factory.
